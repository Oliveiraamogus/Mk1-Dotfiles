# Overview
This is the first version of my dotfiles.

Bear in mind that the repo and its contents were made to be compatible with Arch Linux using Hyprland.

Please be aware that this was my first personal project, as well as my first experience with Arch Linux, Hyprland and Linux customization of this kind, so if the dotfiles and their organization seems arcaic or (extremly) unoptimized, that is the cause.
